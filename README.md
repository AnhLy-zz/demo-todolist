Start the server

Run a npm script to create a local, Node-based http server on localhost:3000 (or 127.0.0.1:3000 for some configurations) by typing:

npm run serve

Open a new tab in your web browser on localhost:3000

# Stop the server

If you ever need to stop the server, use the Ctrl+C keyboard command to quit your current CLI process.

Note: You can't have more than one http server running on the same port (default 3000).

# Watch your files

Open up your favorite text editor and start making changes. Each save will automatically force a browser refresh so you don’t have to do this yourself. This is called live reloading and it’s a nice way of getting a real-time view of your application state.
